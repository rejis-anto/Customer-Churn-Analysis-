The primary purpose of this project is:
Skill Development: To master intermediate-level Excel functionalities relevant to data analytics, such as data cleaning, pivot tables, advanced formulas, and visualizations.
Portfolio Addition: To showcase my data analytics skills in Excel by presenting a structured and impactful analysis that can be included in my resume and GitHub portfolio.
Insight Generation: To derive actionable business insights that help businesses understand customer churn and take strategic actions.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Advanced Formulas (VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, COUNTIF, etc.)
Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
Data Visualization
Analysis of Key Metrics
Creating Actionable Business Recommendations

Dataset Description:

Source:The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
Size: 7043 rows and 21 columns.
Content: Customer demographics, service details, tenure, payment information, and churn status.

Steps Performed:

1. Data Cleaning
Removed null and duplicate values.
Standardized column headers.
Filled missing values 

2. Feature Engineering
Created new features like tenure buckets, churn risk categories, and revenue contributions.
Grouped data into meaningful categories for analysis.

3. Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables
Analyzed churn by demographics, tenure, and contract types.
Examined revenue by region, contract type, and payment method.
Investigated service usage patterns and churn reasons.

4. Visualization
Created charts for churn rate, revenue trends, service usage, and more.
Generated insights using bar charts, pie charts, stacked columns, and Pareto charts.

Key Insights:

Churn Trends: Month-to-month contracts and customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
Revenue Trends: Customers with one-year or two-year contracts contribute more to revenue.
Service Usage: Lack of online security and tech support increases churn likelihood.
Demographics: Senior citizens and customers without dependents show higher churn rates.

Actionable Recommendations:

Implement customer retention strategies for month-to-month contracts.
Offer discounts or incentives for longer-term contracts.
Improve service offerings like tech support and online security to reduce churn.
Target high-risk groups (e.g., short-tenure customers) with personalized retention campaigns.
